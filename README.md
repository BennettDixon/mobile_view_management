## :running: welcome.

Welcome to my demonstration on how to use HOCs in React to manage desktop and mobile views

## :wrench: Setup

Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/BennettDixon/mobile_view_management;
cd mobile_view_management;
```

Install the packages and run the npm start script

```
npm install && npm run start
```

This will start the development server on `localhost:3000`

Navigate there to view the project & play with window resizing / mobile views.
